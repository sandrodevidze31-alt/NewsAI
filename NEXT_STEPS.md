## ‚ùì Questions?

**Q: Do I need to create the accounts right now?**
A: Whenever you're ready! But the sooner you create them, the sooner we can test it.

**Q: What if I don't want to add my credit card to Anthropic?**
A: Unfortunately, Claude API requires payment info. But you can set a monthly budget limit ($20/month) to control costs.

**Q: Can I test without all 4 news APIs?**
A: Technically yes, but you'll get much less news. Minimum: Anthropic + NewsAPI.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: You'll see AI-generated recommendations with confidence scores in the dashboard!

## üöÄ Ready to Continue?

**Just send me:**
1. The 4 API keys (when you have them)
2. Confirmation that Node.js and PostgreSQL are installed

**And I'll handle the rest!**
