## AI Analysis Strategy

### Prompt Engineering Approach
For each news article, the AI will analyze:

1. **Event Type Classification**
   - Product launch
   - Partnership/Acquisition
   - Legal issues
   - Earnings report
   - Executive changes
   - Market expansion

2. **Sentiment Scoring**
   - Overall sentiment (-1 to +1)
   - Confidence level

3. **Historical Context**
   - "When Apple released iPhone X, stock went up 12% in 2 weeks"
   - "Similar legal issues with Company Y caused 8% drop"

4. **Recommendation Generation**
   ```
   STOCK: AAPL
   EVENT: New iPhone 15 Pro announcement
   SENTIMENT: Positive (0.85)
   HISTORICAL PATTERN: Previous iPhone releases showed avg 10% increase
   CURRENT FACTORS:
   - Better specs than previous year ✓
   - Strong pre-orders reported ✓
   - Supply chain stable ✓
   RECOMMENDATION: BUY
   CONFIDENCE: 78%
   RATIONALE: Historical pattern + stronger product + positive market sentiment
   RISK FACTORS: Market volatility, competition from Samsung
   ```

### AI Cost Optimization
- Batch process news articles
- Cache analysis results
- Use GPT-4o-mini instead of GPT-4 (10x cheaper)
- Only analyze high-impact news

## Questions to Consider

Before we start building:

1. **Which AI provider do you prefer?**
   - OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) - More popular, extensive documentation
   - Anthropic Claude (Haiku) - Potentially more analytical
   - Both have similar pricing

2. **Stock focus?**
   - US markets only?
   - Which sectors? (Tech, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
   - How many stocks to track initially? (Recommend 20-50)

3. **Update frequency?**
   - Real-time (expensive, complex)
   - Every hour (reasonable)
   - Twice per day (morning/evening - minimal cost)

4. **Historical data?**
   - How far back to analyze patterns? (Recommend 2-3 years)
   - Manual research or automated collection?
